Problem: Using only for loops and if blocks, write out the R code necessary to print only the elements from the values vector that are not prime.

The following solution begins with a copy of the original values (i.e., 'values2'). Nested for loops detect matches between each element of 'values' and each element of 'primes'. When a match is found, the corresponding value is removed from the 'values2' vector leaving only non-prime values.
```{r}
primes <- c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97)
values <- c(3, 4, 12, 19, 23, 48, 50, 61, 63, 78)
values2 <-c(3, 4, 12, 19, 23, 48, 50, 61, 63, 78)
for (value in values){
  for (prime in primes){
    if (value==prime){
      values2 <- values2[-which(values2==value)]
    }
  }
}
values2
```
