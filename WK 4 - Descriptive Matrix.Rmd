## Descriptive Matrix

Slide 38/39: Generate descriptive statistics for four numeric variables in polity_dataframe.rda (i.e., democ, autoc, polity2, and xconst). The output should be a matrix with the descriptive statistics names as row attributes and the 4 variables named as column attitributes.

```{r}
load("~/Downloads/polity_dataframe.rda")
sub <- polity[, c("democ", "autoc", "polity2", "xconst")]
stats <- function(x){
  return(c(
  n = length(x),
  numberNA = sum(is.na(x)),
  mean = mean(x, na.rm = T),
  median = median(x, na.rm = T),
  stdev = sd(x, na.rm = T),
  max = max(x, na.rm = T),
  min = min(x, na.rm = T)
  ))
}
summaries <- sapply(sub, stats)
summaries_rounded <- apply(summaries, 2, round, 2)
summaries_rounded
str(summaries_rounded)
```
