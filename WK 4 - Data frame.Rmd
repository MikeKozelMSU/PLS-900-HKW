## Data Frame Creation

Slide 37: Create a data frame with a patient ID number, gender, and 3 binary (yes/no) treatment variables.

```{r}
data.frame(
  'Patient'     = 1:16, 
  'Gender'      = rep(c("Male", "Female"), each = 8),
  'Treatment 1' = rep(c("Yes", "No"), each = 4, times = 2),
  'Treatment 2' = rep(c("Yes", "No"), each = 2, times = 4),
  'Treatment 3' = rep(c("Yes", "No"), times = 8),
  stringsAsFactors = FALSE
)
```
